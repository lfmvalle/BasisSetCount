# Core-Effective Potential basis sets

In the present version of this script, *Core-Effective Potential* (CEP) basis sets cannot be distinguished from *all-electron* basis sets, because there is no difference between parsing all-electron basis sets or CEP basis sets.

Any information regarding basis sets will be printed in the same manner, regardless of the type of the basis set.
